# Color-space-comparison-in-cervical-cytology-images
A CNN implementation to classify cervical cytology samples in five classes using SIPAKMED dataset. Twelve color space transformations were compared, the individual RGB channels, 6 and combinations of these channels.  The results obtained form this model is presented in the article: Over Color Spaces Comparison of Cytology Samples Classification.
